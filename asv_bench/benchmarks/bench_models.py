"""ASV benchmark module: per-model rewrite/compile/eval timings.

One pair of classes is generated per discovered model so each lands on
its own dashboard page with its own auto-scaled y-axis. Model timings
span microseconds (eight schools) to seconds (scan/ODE/VAR), which is
unreadable on a single shared plot even in log scale.

Each model gets two sibling classes:

- ``ModelBenchBuild_<model>`` — regular ``setup()`` calls
  ``build_and_measure`` to collect three scalar metrics
  (``rewrite_time``, ``compile_time``, ``n_rewrites``). Each
  ``track_*`` method runs in its own asv subprocess, so the rebuild
  cost is paid three times per (commit, model). We deliberately
  accept that 3× cost instead of caching: every caching strategy we
  tried (asv ``setup_cache``, disk cache keyed by git SHA, disk cache
  keyed by pymc version) had a subtle scoping trap that produced flat
  identical timelines. Re-measuring is slower but obviously correct.
- ``ModelBenchEval_<model>`` — regular ``setup()`` rebuilds the
  compiled function and keeps it on ``self`` so ``time_eval`` can
  call it repeatedly for asv's native steady-state timing.

Total rebuilds per (commit, model): 3 (Build) + 1 (Eval) = 4.

Alphabetical class ordering puts ``Build`` before ``Eval`` (``B < E``),
so ``track_compile_time`` is measured against a cold pytensor NUMBA
disk cache. ``ModelBenchEval`` subsequently rebuilds with a warm cache,
which is fine — ``time_eval`` only cares about steady-state arithmetic.

    """Build + call a trivial pymc model to warm the fresh-process caches.

    asv runs every benchmark in a forked subprocess, so each
    ``ModelBenchBuild`` setup pays cold-start cost for pytensor's
    rewriter and NUMBA's LLVM init. On small models that cold-start
    overhead (~200ms rewrite, ~2s NUMBA init) dominates the measurement
    and drowns out the model-specific signal.

    Running the full pipeline (``build_logp_fn`` + first call) on a
    throwaway one-var model exercises the same code paths as the real
    build, so the subsequent ``build_and_measure`` call runs against
    warm caches and the reported metrics reflect model-specific cost
    rather than process startup.

    Only ``ModelBenchBuild`` uses this — ``ModelBenchEval`` measures
    steady-state arithmetic after its setup's first call, which doesn't
    care whether NUMBA was cold or warm.
